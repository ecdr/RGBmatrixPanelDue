This is a fork of the RGBmatrixPanelDue library by avriot (http://avriot.com/?p=393), which in turn is partly based on the adafruit RGB-matrix-panel library which can be found at https://github.com/adafruit/RGB-matrix-Panel.

Neither of the original libraries contain any license information, but my own hacky changes can be considered MIT-licensed, i.e. don't blame me if my code breaks your matrix/computer/dog/house.


Original readme:
========
This is an Arduino library for our 16x32 RGB LED matrix panels
